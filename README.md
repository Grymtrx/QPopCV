# QPopCV

A tiny desktop app that **watches your screen for WoW queue pops** and sends you a **Discord ping** when they appear.


## What it does

- Looks for the Solo Shuffle queue pop on your screen (top-center area).
- When it sees a pop, it sends a message to your **Discord webhook**.
- The message @mentions **your Discord user** so you don’t miss queues while tabbed out.
- Shows a **“Detected!”** status in the app when a pop is seen.


## Requirements

- **Windows**
- A **Discord webhook URL** (from a channel in your server)
- Your **Discord user ID**
- WoW open with the **queue pop visible** on screen


## Install

1. **Download this repo**
   - On GitHub: `Code → Download ZIP`
